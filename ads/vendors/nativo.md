# Nativo

## Example

```html
<amp-ad
  type="nativo"
  height="350"
  width="400"
  layout="responsive"
  data-request-url="<AMP Article URL>"
>
</amp-ad>
```
## AMP Article URL
The Amp Article URL is the url preceeding the google appended. In the example AMP url:
`https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.testpublisher.com/test/la-xpm-2006-may-16-fi-amp16-story/amp/`
`www.testpublisher.com/test/la-xpm-2006-may-16-fi-amp16-story/amp/` would be the AMP Article URL.
